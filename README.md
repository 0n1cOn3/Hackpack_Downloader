# Hackpack-Downloader
## Description

With Bash and Python, we can automatice the scripting setup into one process


## Getting Started

Have you collected Git Links from time to time and wanted to download them in one go? Then I present you the MegaPack_Downloader

There is a preconfigured repository list. 
This can be adapted as needed. 

The script has the following features:

- Download unlimited number of git links
- Display of the clone status (e.g. 1 of 10)
- Status display (A kind of spinning wheel)
- via flag " 3&>log.txt" a log file is created with all output of the script
(Can be observed continuously with "tail -f log.txt")
- The number of links are automatically detected and displayed during cloning.

### Executing program

```
./Megascript_Downloader.sh
```
