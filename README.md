## Description

Have you ever found yourself wanting to download multiple Git repository links all at once? Look no further than the MegaGIT.

### Getting Started

There's a preconfigured list of repositories that can be adjusted as needed.

The script features:

- Download an unlimited number of Git repository links
- Display of the cloning status (e.g., 1 of 10)
- Status display (A kind of spinning wheel)
- Creation of a log file with all script output via the flag "3&>log.txt" (can be continuously observed with "tail -f log.txt")
- The number of links is automatically detected and displayed during cloning.
